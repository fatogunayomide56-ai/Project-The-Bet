The Bet: The Metals Index

# Introduction

In 1980, economist Julian Simon and biologist Paul Ehrlich made a public wager reflecting their opposing views on resource scarcity. Ehrlich, concerned about population growth and environmental limits, predicted that essential raw materials would become scarcer and more expensive over time. Simon disagreed, believing human innovation and market forces would increase resource availability and reduce costs.

The wager focused on five metals: tungsten, copper, chromium, nickel, and tin, over a ten-year period. This historic bet provides a unique lens into debates about economic optimism, environmental constraints, and the impact of human ingenuity on resource availability.

# The Issue

The Simon-Ehrlich bet centers on a critical question: Are natural resources limited, or can innovation and markets overcome scarcity?

Ehrlich’s View: Rising population will outstrip natural resources, causing soaring commodity prices and ecological risks.

Simon’s View: Scarcity encourages invention, efficiency, and substitution, keeping resources abundant and prices stable.

The bet was designed to test these opposing theories with real-world commodity prices over a decade.

# Methodology

Wager Setup: Ehrlich selected $1,000 worth of each metal in 1980, predicting prices would rise by 1990. Simon bet that prices would fall.

Data Analysis:

Collected historical prices for the five metals.

Adjusted prices for inflation.

Created a Simple Real Price Index, normalizing 1980 prices as the base year to visualize price trends.

Evaluation: Compared inflation-adjusted prices in 1990 to the 1980 baseline to determine the winner.

# Results

Between 1980 and 1990, all five metals experienced declines in real prices.

The Simple Real Price Index demonstrates that Simon’s hypothesis was correct: market forces, innovation, and efficiency reduced resource costs despite global demand growth.

Outcome: Ehrlich lost the bet and paid Simon the agreed amount.

# Relevance Then (1980–1990)

The early 1980s were marked by economic uncertainty and environmental debates.

Simon’s argument was validated as market mechanisms and technological improvements kept resource prices in check.

The index visualizations clearly illustrate declining metal prices, confirming Simon’s optimism about human ingenuity.

# Relevance Now (2025)

Simon-Ehrlich debates remain relevant in contemporary discussions on sustainability and resource management.

While innovation continues to moderate some resource prices, global consumption, climate change, and ecological limits have increased pressure on critical materials.

Metals like lithium and cobalt are now in high demand due to renewable energy technologies, illustrating that market efficiency alone cannot guarantee ecological sustainability.

Key Insight: Simon won the wager on commodity prices, but Ehrlich’s warnings about environmental limits are increasingly urgent.

# Concluding Comments

The Simon-Ehrlich Bet illustrates the tension between economic optimism and environmental prudence.

Policy implications include:

Investing in green technologies.

Ensuring resilient supply chains for critical minerals.

Implementing long-term environmental safeguards alongside market solutions.

Lesson: Prices can fall due to innovation, but no market can restore ecosystems that have collapsed.
